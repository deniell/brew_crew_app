# Documentation

A study Flutter project based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfA3NWDBPZ4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9j--TKIdkb3ISfRbJeJYQwC). As a result I will have a complete app with a database (Firebase Firestore) and an authentication system (using Firebase auth).

## Run the app
> to ran the app replace file android/app/google-services.json.dist with android/app/google-services.json file which contain your Firebase credentials inside.
